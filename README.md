# Magazine Check Interrupt
Seamlessly transition from a magazine check to a reload!

---

**Mag Check Interrupt** allows you to interrupt a magazine check mid-animation and transition into a reload.

### Features
- Continue directly into a reload, no need to wait for the magazine check animation to finish
- Finish the magazine check animation if no action is taken
- Slow down animation during the reload window, to give you ample time to decide if you need to reload. Animations vary per magazine and some can be fast
- Configuration is available client side

### Configuration
In the BepInEx configuration manager (<kbd>F12</kbd>)
- `Enable Slow Animation` - Slow down the magazine check animation for a brief moment. Default is `true`

Advanced Configuration
- `Reload Window Start` - How early you can reload during the magazine check animation, in normalized time
- `Reload Window End` - How late you can reload during the magazine check animation, in normalized time
- `Slow Percentage` - Multiplier for the magazine check animation speed when Slow Animation is enabled
- `Slow Animation Start` - When to start slowing down the magazine check animation, in normalized time
- `Slow Animation End` - When to restore speed of the magazine check animation, in normalized time
- `Smoothing Max Delta` - Max delta for the smoothing of the slow animation. A higher value slows/restores the animation faster

### Compatibility
- Compatible with [Project Fika](https://forge.sp-tarkov.com/mod/2326/project-fika)
- Partially compatible with [UI Fixes](https://forge.sp-tarkov.com/mod/1342/ui-fixes). Reload in Place feature is queued instead of transitioning directly into a reload
